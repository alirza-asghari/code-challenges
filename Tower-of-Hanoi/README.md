# Tower of Hanoi

Welcome to the Tower of Hanoi game!


The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

Your task is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Enjoy solving the puzzle and have fun with Tower of Hanoi!
