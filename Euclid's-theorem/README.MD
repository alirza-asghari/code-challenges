# Euclid's Theorem: Representation of Numbers as Products of Prime Numbers
Euclid's theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

For example, the number 12 can be represented as 
2×2×3, where 2 and 3 are prime numbers. This representation is unique up to the order of the factors. However, the theorem does not specify the sequence in which the prime factors should be written.

Usage
The provided code takes a positive integer as input and returns the prime factors of that number. These prime factors, when multiplied together, equal the input number.

Example
Suppose we have the number 36. The prime factors of 36 are 
2×2×3×3. Running the code with input 36 will return the prime factors: 2, 2, 3, and 3.
